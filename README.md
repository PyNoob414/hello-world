# hello-world
My place to store ideas, resources, and collaborate with others

Pynoob414, looking to master python and make some cool stuff in the process. I will never forget \
the first time I found an error in a simple pong game that I was attempting, the feeling of \
accomplishment when the right and left paddle appeared then the ball, etc. Coding is my new passion.\
I really hope I can start freelancing as a web-developer and create the next best thing, or the \ 
latest and greatest game. I can't wait to meet people who have started out with no knowledge of \
computer code and honed their skills to land exciting jobs.
